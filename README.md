# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

-My strategy for digging into the codebase was starting with the smallest piece and seeing how they interact with bigger pieces. For this prject, vehicle seemed to be the smallest obejct followed by facility and dmv so I started looking in the vehicle class and worked up.

What was hard about working with code you did not write?

-The hard part was figuring out what the purpose of some of the functions were and what they returned.

What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

-One thing that made reading the codebase a lot easier was it's adherence to ruby prinicples. The code was formatted and variables named in such a way that made it easy to understand what type of data they were storing and what the methods were doing.
